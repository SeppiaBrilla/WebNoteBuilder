# Web Note Builder

A very simple (and ugly) example of how to use the [Web Obsidian Builder](https://github.com/SeppiaBrilla/Web-Obsidian-Builder) library.
This code is not pretty nor perfect and the resulting website is very simple. Please take this as n little project and not as an example to replicate.
